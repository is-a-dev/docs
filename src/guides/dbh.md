If you are on a free plan, choose any US proxy or you can use the Donator Proxy If you are a Donator, note the IP address of the proxy you chose.

### Creating the domain file

Create a JSON file inside `domains` directory (`domains/subdomain.json`) with the following content and submit a pull request:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "github-username",
        "email": "me@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "A": ["proxy-ip-here"]
    }
}
```

**Note:** In the owner section, you can add any social media handle, such as Discord. If you add another social media account, you may omit the email field. However, the GitHub username is mandatory. Don't forget to provide a preview of your website in your pull request.

## Configuring

After your pull request is merged, get your server ID by running this command:

```
dbh!server list
```

You will get a reply like this:

Note down the server ID, then execute following command:

```
dbh!server proxy your-subdomain.is-a.dev yourserverid
```
