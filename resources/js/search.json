You can click the link here to do so.","After you've forked our repository, you can start making the file for your domain. To make the file, enter your fork of our repository (which you should already be there), enter the domains directory, also known as a folder, and create the file from there.","You may be wondering, \"How should I name the file?\" The filename should be the domain name you want in lowercase followed by the JSON extension (.json) at the end of the filename, so it would be something like this: subdomain.json(Replace subdomain with the name you want to register, of course). For more information about what filenames are valid or invalid, click here.","After you've finished with the filename, you can start making the file format of the JSON file. Depending on your hosting provider, we have guides for most hosting providers (like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages and Vercel, just to name a few) accessible in our documentation, but for hosting providers that don't have a guide, you should pay attention to what records they provide. An example of a valid file format is the one listed below, though you can also check out the Domain Structure section to see what records we support.","You should replace the placeholder username with your own GitHub username and the placeholder records with the valid records your hosting provider gave while trying to connect the domain.","When you've made sure that you have the valid file format and the correct filename, you can now start making a pull request. If you aren't sure if the JSON format is valid, you can check with jsonlint."]},{"l":"Making the pull request","p":["Assuming you know how GitHub works, it should be easy for you to make a pull request to our repository.

Please also add a preview of your website with both the link to your website and a screenshot of your website in the pull request description.","When you've completed it, you can create the pull request and wait for the maintainers to review it.
